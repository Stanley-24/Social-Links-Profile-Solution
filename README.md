### What I learned

To be honest at first i wasn't sure of what to do when i first joined the challenge, that was yesterday Monday Apr-8-2024, i just close my computer because i'm still in my programming learning, so today i said let me inspect someone else project online, i didn't copy from her but i did look at her code and write out my own and also fiqure out why it was written that way and why it work and i'm proud of myself because this is something i haven't done before, so thanks to everyone out there putting in the work because this is not easy to understand but something you will love doing by the time you understand the basics and rules of different languages.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: whitesmoke;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```


### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to focus on refining advanced CSS techniques, mastering responsive design principles, and deepening my understanding of accessibility best practices. Additionally, I aim to optimize performance, enhance JavaScript proficiency, strengthen version control skills, and deepen my knowledge of user experience design. These areas will ensure I deliver high-quality, user-centric projects with improved efficiency and effectiveness.

### Useful resources

- The website I inspected was [Omar Ibrahim](https://omaribrahim2002.github.io/Social-Links-Profile/) - It served as a valuable reference for understanding how to initiate my project. I want to clarify that while I reviewed her code for guidance, I didn't copy it. Instead, I analyzed it to comprehend the reasons behind its functionality compared to mine. This comparison helped me identify and rectify errors I encountered. I'm grateful to her for the excellent work she has done on her designs.
